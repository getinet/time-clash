## A Simple Chrome Extension That Keeps My Harvest Times Honest

If you use Harvest to track your time, you’ve probably had this happen: you log your day, feel productive, then later realize two entries overlap. Suddenly your totals are off, your reports don’t add up, and now you’re wondering if you accidentally invented time travel.

I got tired of that. So I built a small Chrome extension Time Clash, that checks your Harvest timesheet for overlapping entries and highlights them in red. Simple, visual, and surprisingly satisfying.

**Why I Built It**

As a product designer and consultant, I’m often juggling multiple clients and projects in a single day. That means switching contexts fast and logging time just as quickly. Harvest is great for tracking hours, but it doesn’t warn you when two entries overlap.

You might think you worked from 9:00 to 10:00 on one project and 9:30 to 10:30 on another—but in reality, you just double-counted 30 minutes. Not ideal when accuracy matters.

This little extension solves that by automatically flagging any overlapping entries right inside your Harvest timesheet. It’s basically a “time sanity check” that Harvest should’ve built in from the start.

**How It Works**


Once installed, the extension quietly scans your daily entries every time you open your timesheet. If it spots any overlaps, it highlights them in red so you can fix them instantly.

No popups, no alerts, no clicking through settings—just a clear visual cue that something needs adjusting.

**Why Harvest Should Totally Steal This Idea**

This is one of those small, quality-of-life features that would make a big difference for anyone managing multiple projects. It saves time, reduces errors, and helps keep reports accurate.

Until Harvest adds something like this natively, this extension fills the gap nicely.

**How to Install It**

You can set it up in a couple of minutes:

 1. Download or clone the extension files from here.
 2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions. 
 3. Toggle Developer mode on in the top right corner. 
 4. Click Load unpacked and select the folder with the extension files.  
 5. Open your __Harvest Timesheet__ the extension will automatically highlight any overlapping entries.

That’s it. No setup, no accounts, no extra steps. Just cleaner timesheets and fewer “wait, how did I work 25 hours today?” moments.
